2/17/2026 12:10,InstructorTest,BRA,Inequality Trends in Brazil (2012â€“2023),"Brazil’s measured income inequality has fallen modestly over the past decade. 
WIID’s latest estimate (Gini = 48, reference year 2020-2022 depending on series) 
places Brazil among the most unequal countries globally, but below its early-2000s peak. 

### Key Drivers of Change
- **Expansion of social transfers:** Bolsa Familia and other cash-transfer programs 
  improved inequality-adjusted incomes among rural and very poor households.
- **Labor market shifts:** Rising formal employment between 2012-2018 contributed 
  to narrowing wage gaps.
- **COVID-19 shock and recovery:** Emergency Aid temporarily lowered measured 
  inequality in 2020, but effects were uneven and partially reversed by 2022.

### Measurement Considerations
- Brazil’s inequality figures vary depending on whether **income** or 
  **consumption** is used, and whether values are **per capita** or **equivalized**.
- Survey-to-survey differences (PNAD-C vs. household budget surveys) can shift 
  estimates, so trends should be interpreted with caution.

Overall, Brazil shows slow but meaningful progress driven by redistribution programs 
and structural changes in the labor market, though high inequality persists in both 
regional and racial dimensions. capita** or **equivalized**.
